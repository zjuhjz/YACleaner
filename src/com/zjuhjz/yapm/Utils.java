	 * Running an app through root isn't even that straightforward as

	 * we try to workaround here:
	 *
	 *  1) The Superuser Whitelist application most rooted devices
	 *     use identifies the command based on arguments. If we
	 *     were to just call su -c "pm xyz", the user would need
	 *     to confirm every single call; "Allows allow" would be
	 *     useless.
	 *
	 *  2) Rarely, a devices seems to have a su-executable that uses a
	 *     different argument syntax (`su -c "command args"` vs.
	 *     `su -c command args`).
	 *
	 *  3) Some ROMs have their "su" in a non-standard location, like
	 *     Archos in /data/bin, and it's not on the path either (this
	 *     is because they don't have write-access to /system yet).
	 *
	 *  4) Some custom ROMs contain what seems to be a kernel bug,
	 *     in which su/sh?, when run outside of the system shell,
	 *     cannot access certain paths. The error is "pm: not found".
	 *     This happens even though the file does exists, and runs
	 *     just fine from the shell.
	 *
	 * The common approach chosen by most root apps seems to be to
	 * run "su" and pipe commands into it. This will solve (1) and (2).
	 * (3) we solve by checking multiple locations for su.
	 * We'll still have to see about (4).
